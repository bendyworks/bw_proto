            Agile course correction requires constant feedback, and we keep our lines of communication clear and free for our clients. Bendyworks believes in daily, efficient contact in a way that works for you. With regular feedback your software will take shape around your changing needs and priorities without the rigid demands of traditional software development.

         Software projects rarely end up exactly where you planned at the beginning. Because we charge by time and materials, you can change the scope of your project in a natural way as it evolves. Need new features? Need to stop a project and start it up again later? Bendyworks is flexible enough to adjust to your needs on the fly, without having to rework a contract.            </p>

          We work in pairs.
        </h2>
        <p class="value-description">
          Our programmers come dual-core. We adhere to the agile principle of pair programming to improve the accuracy, elegance, and development time of the software we write for you. With constant code review, superior project navigation, and instant bug detection, there really is no better way to develop software. Pair programming takes experience, trust, creativity, and talent—qualities each coder at Bendyworks brings to the table.

        We use BDD and TDD.
      </h2>
      <p class="value-description">
        By taking the traditional development path and turning it on its head, Test Driven Development and Behavior Driven Development both dramatically speed up the development time and improve the accuracy of a project.

        BDD puts the purpose of code in natural, plain language—so you never lose focus of what should come next and why. TDD focuses on what each part of a program should do, determining what it would look like for code to be successful and then developing it from there. Put them together, and it's just feature delivery after feature delivery.      </p>
